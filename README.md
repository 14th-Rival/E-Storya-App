# E-Storya
E-Storya a messaging app made to connect with your friends

This is the first Android Application I made to include in my portfolio.
Currently, this project is at Version 1.0 and undergoing development.

- The server used in this application was based on SOCKET.IO created by @joyceHong0524
- The application can now accomodate the following:
    - a) Basic Chat 
        - Make or Join a Room
        - Interaction between Sender and Receiver
    - b) Profile Picture/Avatar
        - Have a basic set of images to choose from
        
TODO:
  - Users can insert Images, Videos, and other media
  - UI Improvements
  - Code Improvements
